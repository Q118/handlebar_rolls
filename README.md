# Handlebar Rolls

![](https://github.com/Q118/track_mysql_employees/blob/master/sushi-app-screenshot.png)

A sushi logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Aim is to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.
